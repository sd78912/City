            Howrah Bridge is a balanced cantilever bridge over the Hooghly River
            in West Bengal, India. Commissioned in 1943, the bridge was
            originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a
            pontoon bridge at the same location linking the two cities of Howrah
            and Kolkata (Calcutta). On 14 June 1965 it was renamed Rabindra Setu
            after the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first
            Indian and Asian Nobel laureate. It is still popularly known as the
            Howrah Bridge.

          <br />
          <p2>
            The bridge is one of four on the Hooghly River and is a famous
            symbol of Kolkata and West Bengal. The other bridges are the
            Vidyasagar Setu (popularly called the Second Hooghly Bridge), the
            Vivekananda Setu and the newly built Nivedita Setu. It weathers the
            storms of the Bay of Bengal region, carrying a daily traffic of
            approximately 100,000 vehicles and possibly more than 150,000
            pedestrians, easily making it the busiest cantilever bridge in the
            world. The third-longest cantilever bridge at the time of its
            construction, the Howrah Bridge is currently the sixth-longest
            bridge of its type in the world.

            Victoria Memorial is one of the famous and beautiful monuments of
            Kolkata. It was built between 1906 and 1921 to commemorate Queen
            Victoria's 25-year reign in India. After the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857,
            the British government gathered the reins of control of the country
            directly, and in 1876 the British parliament made Victoria the
            Empress of India. Her reign ended with her death in 1901.

          <br />
          <br />
          <p2>
            The Victoria Memorial is possibly the most awesome reminder of the
            Raj to be found in India. This huge white-marble museum, made from
            Makrana marbles from Rajasthan, is filled with a vast collection of
            remnants from the period of British Empire rule in India. The forms
            in the museum like the great dome, clustered with four subsidiary,
            octagonal domed chattris, the high portals, the terrace and the
            domed corner towers speak of a splendid richness in architecture.
            The Memorial is situated on 64 acres of land with the building
            covering 338 ft by 228 ft.

          <br />
          <br />
          <p3>
            The Victoria Memorial is a landmark in the history of Indian
            architecture and the credit for that justly goes to Lord Curzon who
            chose persons like Sir William Emerson, President of the British
            Institute of Architects, to design and plan the building and entrust
            the construction work to the very famous Messrs. Martin & Co. of
            Calcutta.

            Eden Gardens is a cricket ground in Kolkata, India. Established in
            1864, it is the oldest and second-largest cricket stadium in India
            after the newly built Narendra Modi Stadium and third in the world
            after Narendra Modi Stadium and Melbourne Cricket Ground. The
            stadium currently has a capacity of 80,000. On 22 November 2019, the
            venue hosted the first ever day/night Test match in India during the
            second Test between India and Bangladesh.

            Eden Gardens is often referred to as home of Indian cricket. It has
            the fastest outfield of all the cricket stadiums in India, and is
            regarded as a "batsman's paradise". The ground has been referred to
            as "cricket's answer to the Colosseum". Eden Gardens is called the
            “Mecca of Indian cricket”, due to it being the first officially
            built ground for the game of cricket in India. Eden Gardens has
            hosted matches in major international competitions including the
            World Cup, World Twenty20 and Asia Cup. In 1987, Eden Gardens became
            the second stadium to host a World Cup final. The 2016 ICC World
            Twenty20 final was held at the stadium, with the West Indies beat
            England in a closely fought encounter.

            The stadium was established in 1864. It takes its name from the Eden
            Gardens, one of the oldest parks in Kolkata, adjacent to the
            stadium, designed in 1841 and named after the Eden sisters of Lord
            Auckland, the then Governor-General of India. Initially it was named
            'Auckland Circus Gardens' but later changed to 'Eden Gardens' by its
            makers inspired by Garden of Eden in the Bible. According to popular
            culture, Babu Rajchandra Das, the then zamindar (landlord) of
            Kolkata, had gifted one of his biggest gardens besides river
            Hooghly, to Viceroy Lord Auckland Eden and his sister Emily Eden
            after they helped him by saving his 3rd daughter from a fatal
            disease. From then onwards the garden's name was changed from Mar
            Bagan to Eden Gardens. The cricket grounds were built between
            Babughat and Fort William. The stadium is in the B. B. D. Bagh area
            of the city, near the State Secretariat and opposite to the Calcutta
            High Court.

            Kumortuli or the potter’s colony of Kolkata was by far one of the
            most fascinating highlights of the city for me. The colony is
            reknown for their production of clay idols of Hindu gods and
            goddesses. I visited before the big Kali festival, so many sculptors
            were busy at work sculpting Kali goddess statues. There are hundreds
            of potter shops and their work supplies Kolkata and is exported
            throughout India. It was helpful to be accompanied by a guide I had
            for a half day tour with Viator. While much of Kumortoli seems
            self-explanatory, wandering the shops alone might have felt a little
            awkward for me. Having a guide helped me to get closer with my
            camera.

            The British colonisation of Bengal and India started following the
            victory of the British East India Company in the Battle of Plassey
            in 1757. The Company decided to build new settlement Fort William at
            the site of the Gobindapur village. Most of the existing population
            shifted to Sutanuti. While such neighbourhoods as Jorasanko and
            Pathuriaghata became the centres of the local rich, there were other
            areas that were developed simultaneously.The villages of
            Gobindapur, Sutanuti and Kalikata developed to give rise to the
            latter day metropolis of Calcutta.
